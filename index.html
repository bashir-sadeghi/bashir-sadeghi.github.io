                        deep learning, optimization, and signal processing. My work spans theory and practice:
                        from developing new ML algorithms and publishing in venues such as TMLR, IEEE TSP,
                        CVPR, ICCV, and ECML, to building software systems for scientific data analysis. -->
                        I am a motivated professional in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) engineering
                        with a strong background in deep learning, signal processing, and computer vision.
                        My experience spans both theory and applications, from designing and implementing innovative ML
                        algorithms to building software solutions for scientific data analysis.
                        I have contributed to NSF-funded research projects and authored high-impact journal and
                        conference papers in venues such as CVPR, ICCV, TMLR, IEEE TSP, NIMA, and ECML.
                        My work has also led to multiple patents in the field of adversarial machine learning.

                        I enjoy designing end-to-end AI solutions, including data collection and cleaning,
                        predictive model design, APIs, and user-facing tools, especially for high-dimensional
                        and scientific data. Currently, I work on machine-learning-assisted radiation detector pulse
                        analysis at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB), including peak fitting, classification,
                        and integration of ML into data acquisition (DAQ) workflows.
