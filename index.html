                        CVPR, ICCV, and ECML, to building software systems for scientific data analysis. -->
                        I am a motivated professional in machine learning (ML) science and artificial intelligence (AI)
                        engineering with a strong background in deep learning, signal processing, and computer vision.
                        My experience spans theory and applications, from designing and implementing innovative ML algorithms
                        to building software solutions for scientific data analysis.

                        Designed an end-to-end AI system for radiation detector pulse analysis, including data
                        preprocessing pipelines, ML-based peak fitting, classification, and uncertainty
                        estimation. Integrated Python/PyTorch models with existing C++-based spectroscopy tools
                        and DAQ workflows. Focused on reliability, robustness, and monitoring of model behavior
                        under real laboratory conditions.

                        <strong>AI Audio/Video Assistant (LLM-Integrated App)</strong> (in progress)<br />
                        Developing a lightweight web application that uses LLM and speech APIs (OpenAI / Whisper)
                        to provide transcription and summarization for uploaded audio, with a planned extension to
                        auto-caption generation for video. Backend implemented with FastAPI, integrating external AI model
                        endpoints. Frontend kept intentionally simple (HTML/CSS/JS) for fast iteration. Emphasis on prompt design,
                        model behavior monitoring, and responsible use of generative AI.

                        <strong>Invariant & Fair Representation Learning Framework</strong><br />
                        Built research codebases implementing invariant representation learning, adversarially
                        robust features, and model bias analysis. Developed reusable Python modules for training,
                        evaluation, and visualization of fairness/utility trade-offs. Work resulted in publications
                        at TMLR, CVPR, ICCV, and ECML, and aligns with responsible AI practices (bias assessment,
                        privacy, stability).
